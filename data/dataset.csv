It's a great product,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used it for approx 5 months ...it's a damn good for face.it just improve your skin .you can't imagine.one flaw is that of this face wash is it doesn't remove oil from your face but it gives brightness to your face.,Reviewed in India on 15 June 2022,,,
Good 👍,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all tha delivery was on time and the product came with well packed and sealed and it has expiry date till 04/2022 and I have purchased this product from cloudtail retailer on Amazon.Now coming to the forest essential delicate facial cleanser, it's just ok product. I didn't find anything worth spending 1250 rs for this. There is much more better option in the market for cheaper price.  For one time purchase it's good and am not going to buy this again by wasting 1250rs. And this my personal opinion . If you want to try I would like to suggest go for 50ml rather than buying 200ml.And  my rating is completely based on how the product came to me, expiry date, packaging etc.",Reviewed in India on 29 July 2020,,,

Try it out,4.0 out of 5 stars,Those who have acne or pimple problems can use it but it depends from person to person. It was good for me but not that great. It best suited my sister's skin.

Can be easily used for any skin type.,5.0 out of 5 stars,So I have been using this face wash since  2 years or so. The fragrance is quiet decent & it leaves the skin shining and refreshing.

"A bit pricey, but little goes long way...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the small bottle. Its fragrance is mild, but heavenly.. Just like every forest essentials product, smell takes over.It is sensitive on skin, the name says it all.. gently cleanses, no breakouts from using it. but only drawback is even with saffron and honey, it doesn't improve the skin tone. Definitely not a whitening face wash. It surely does brightens up the face for an hour or two. That's enough for a face wash, I guess..",Reviewed in India on 5 October 2020,2 people found this helpful,,

Haven’t had acne/pimples since 6months now! Wonder Wash!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was introduced to Forest Essentials facewash by a friend in Jan’20 and since then I have stuck to this brand of facewash only. I haven’t had a breakout of acne/pimples since Jan’20 which otherwise I had every month! Very refreshing and light on the skin, I use it daily, and a small amount works wonders! I keep switching between this one and rose honey lemon one from the same brand. A small bottle lasts me months, may be because I mostly use it once a day only. Have tried all herbal and non herbal brands(Indian and Foreign) but nothing has helped me to keep a tight check on pimples/clear skin as Forest Essentials Face Cleanser! Go for it. Try with a small size to check your skin compatibility.",Reviewed in India on 12 August 2020,5 people found this helpful,,

Diluted with Water - destroyed a good product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first bought this product, I was in love with it due to its fragrance and quality. However, Forest Essential has diluted this product so much with water, its no longer a face wash but some water solution. you can use the small bottle only 3-4 times at best.

"Expensive, fragrant, good for dry skin, might have to use more than once for oily.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly, the cleanser comes in a plastic bottle and not glass. Second, the fragrance is amazing! It feels heavenly and luxurious. Third, it doesn't strip your skin of oils, it's mild but other than the fragrance the actual 'cleansing' experience isn't that great. Feels like rinsing oily skin with water, then a rubbery feel. You might have to use it twice if your skin is oily. After patting your skin dry, it feels good, the fragrance specially stays on for so long.❤️ The price for such quantity is quite high.",Reviewed in India on 12 August 2020,4 people found this helpful,,

Wet your face with warm water, and take 2 pumps and use circular motion to cleanse. Don't expect a lot of lather, it's a good thing it doesn't lather much, but it cleanses really well.I sure wish Forest Essentials products had better packaging.

Hello to soft skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,This face cleanser is a glorified face wash and not a makeup remover.But I still love it.You're supposed to use it on a damp face.Be careful and take only a teeny tiny bit.It won't lather.And the effect(skin so soft that I can't resist touching it again and again) will be noticeable only after using it consistently for 3-4 days.Stop using it for a couple of days and then it is bye bye soft skin.It doesn't do a single blessed thing about blemishes.But then I had zero expectations about that.I haven't noticed any glow either.The fragrance is heavenly! It is so subtle and is a blessing to people who can't stand strong perfumes.And the pump is so convenient.,Reviewed in India on 22 September 2016,2 people found this helpful,,

Deception and Forest Essentials are Synonyms,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The nozzles on all their bottles are 5 out of 10 times either broken or LEAKY.I have managed to purchase 75% of all of their products — minus the soaps, body oils, hair oils and dusting powders (because who even pays a fortune for your regular organic soap/oil that I can whip up at home! Or better yet, get an excellent alternative elsewhere!)Anyhow, I mailed them to ask for the ingredients list of certain products because they are super secretive about what goes into their “all natural” range of skincare. What did I find?Nothing special.They lie to the customers (foreign customers) and run on deception. For example: NARANGI IS ORANGE!Now, the ingredients list would have English names and then there’s “narangi extract”, narangi peel powder, etc.(???)Why?!Let me tell you what I have figured from testing about 20-30 products of theirs:• flimsy packaging in the name of “reducing plastic”.• clever way of using the kind of spray nozzles that spray so much you’ll be done with the bottle before you start noticing a difference/change.(I have preferred to transfer them into a bottle of rose water from another brand, and that fixed the problem for me because I really like the panchpushp!)• The products aren’t all bad but they’re not anything special. The effect that makes you go wow wears off as your skin adapts to their products (tested this on a few skin types).• their room surround spray nozzles leak heavily. They have completely removed any seals from room sprays!!! They evaporate!!! Why would you risk having something be spilled by children or even adults with loose room spray nozzles!?I had to find a way to hold the lid in place along with the nozzle. Every time I open the nozzle there’s tonnes of evaporated spray + oils spilled onto the inside of the lid and on the spray nozzle.• complete cheapskates. I purchased ALL five of their ubtan range and each of them have just 1-2 at most 3 different ingredients which make them “unique” so you’re forced to purchase the others. The rest of the ingredients are the exact same or repeated!All in the name of profits, sales, and “luxurious Ayurveda”.• Some of their products like the orange and sandalwood moisturizer, quality and formulation are both sub par.• I hope we have all been familiarized with the fair and lovely scent? Their velvet silk cream moisturizer smells the exact same. A total ripoff! And super greasy (my humble apologies to the acne-prone / combination skin bearers).I speak from experience with blending, mixing, pounding and formulating my own skincare for years.I own (in total) over 70 essential + carrier oils and herbal tinctures + powdered products. I know what I’m talking about.It is when you purchase a set of all products from a range (like all 5 ubtan mixes they offer, or all of different rose spray, perfume and room spray etc) is when you realize how you’re being tricked by pretty packaging and some fake reviews (yes I said fake!)The website at least has 90% reviews that are not by real customers. Because who repetitively uses the title “Forest Essentials” over and over in a review, OR, who has the time to write the product name exactly as it is with certain reiterated vocabulary in each and every review?I mean, come on! *scoffs*The ojas balm smells like my mother‘s pain  relief oil that her Ayurvedic doctor blended for her. And it was not half as expensive as the one that’s sold.The only thing that really does knock the charts off is the date and lichee night cream. The only good skincare item.Oh and did I forget to mention? The Rose cardamom body spray, the rose surround spray and the rose perfume do not smell very different from each other?And the toners/hydrosol bottles too, leak when spraying. They don’t just spray a lot, they also leak! I have tried 3-4 of those bottles. It’s not just one defective product, as I too decided that it was, until every other bottle nozzle would do the same! I’m not paying 2k+ for pretty (read: cheap) packaging you know.And the mashobra honey face cleanser is a super mild version of this kashmir saffron cleanser with a couple extra ingredients tossed and taken off the list. Not much difference there.Still want to go ahead and get their products? Sure do, it’s everyone's prerogative to be associated with whoever or whatever. One may pay for the pretty packaging that’s defective I guess.And for the customer support? No. Just no.Someone (I do not wish to take any names) on support team via email, replies to a part of your message and not all of it. Deliberate effort to avoid replying to a part of a message multiple times. (PS:) I tried asking from separate emails (different timelines) just to check if it’s just me or are they really trying to avoid certain questions (and yes they are).It is as though they are trying to avoid giving out information even though, I, as a customer am entitled to that information. What I mean is, the questions weren’t wrong or avoidable either. As a customer you have the right to know what ingredients go in a product whether chemical or not. This should not be too difficult to answer. I have not completely knocked chemicals off my skincare just yet, so it does not make a difference to me to know if it’s completely ‘natural’ or not! I just want to know.They pride themselves on absolutely nothing but deception and ornate packaging. I laugh.I am not surprised that we are being cheated the way that we are because well, who runs on integrity these days, deceit is the new black, deception is the fuel.Also, ONLY IF this particular review is beneficial to you or to your family, then please do share (screenshot, perhaps). Because my review was taken down last time (sorry the product I reviewed was taken down to keep this review from showing, and so my review went down with it)Edited to add: If you purchase here, you’ll receive low-quality stock that smells old/rancid because they think rejects can be sold here and they won’t be questioned about it. You will not find the stuff they sell in their retail outlets here because they can get away with it here.Hope this helps someone!PS: If this review does not appear as verified purchase then please rest assured that I only review products I own.

There was no response to it. In my grievance I had even mentioned that the same thing had happened with me when I had bought another Forest Essential product almost a year ago and contacted customer support team in vain.So in my experience Forest Essential has failed me twice consistently and without any regret or remorse.This was clearly my last purchase from Forest Essentials.",Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,One person found this helpful,,

The amazing refreshing smell,4.0 out of 5 stars,I almost never repeat face washes unless and until it really impresses me. I  started with pond’s and pears face wash ( I used to buy them with my pocket money since the concept of face washes was new and my Mumma thought it as another one of my crazy expenses.)PROS:The fact that it is chemical free!!!!The amazing refreshing smell.Gives an instant glow to my face.I have noticed a teeny reduction of my gigantic pores after I have started using it but I am also using Fabindia rose water so i guess it is a joined effort of both the products.It is suitable for all skin types..even sensitive skin.A very small quantity is required for one wash hence it will last me a loong time.Does not dry my skin. Although I have combination skin I do not like face washes that strip my face of all the moisture.CONSI cannot think of anything except the price.But I am willing to spend this much on a fab product like this.And since it is too mild i mean if you have travelled and have all that grime and dust on your face..i feel using this face wash only wont give you a squeaky clean feel because it lathers very less. I therefore don’t use it after I come home in the evening after office.,Reviewed in India on 14 July 2017,11 people found this helpful,,

Does not dries up the skin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, it does not dries up the skin but  nothing other than that is out of the box, gives same results asordinary facewashesBut should try if you can afford.",Reviewed in India on 2 October 2022,,,
Average Results / Strong Rose scent / Review after using entire bottle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this delivered in March 2nd week and the bottle has almost come to end; I use it mostly once or max twice a day to wash my face - so lasted about 3-3.5 month for one person. You need very small quantity of it to wash.The face wash has strong rose scent - initially -  it is overpowering but you get used to it. No other notes are discernible except for rose.There is no visible change to face as such but it is not a drying face wash , i have combination skin and I did not notice any drying ; on contrary I feel it does not clear out oil on nose very well and I had use to charcoal nose -strip every week to remove white heads.Overall - my verdict is that it is a mild face wash with a slightly over powering rose scent ; the Neem & saffron face wash of same brand has better fragrance ( I have used that one as well) .  Also - it is not 100% chemical free just that it is a glycerin/honey based face wash. but this also contains Tochopheryl Acetate.Buy it - if you have money and extra sensitive skin ; otherwise do not expect any dramatic results for your skin.If my review has helped you - pls press helpful.",Reviewed in India on 27 July 2020,185 people found this helpful,,

Ok,4.0 out of 5 stars,I do not like the new packaging. It has a bigger opening due to which a large amount of liquid comes out. I think there is some problem with the cap too.

Haven’t had Acne/Pimples since 6months! Wonder Wash!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was introduced to Forest Essentials facewash by a friend in Jan’20 and since then I have stuck to this brand of facewash only. I haven’t had a breakout of acne/pimples since Jan’20 which otherwise I had every month! Very refreshing and light on the skin, I use it daily, and a small amount works wonders! I keep switching between this one and saffron neem one from the same brand. A small bottle lasts me months, may be because I mostly use it once a day only. Have tried all herbal and non herbal brands(Indian and Foreign) but nothing has helped me to keep a tight check on pimples/clear skin as Forest Essentials Face Cleanser! Go for it.

Horrible Product. Doesn't work at all,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible Product. Doesn't work at all. I have been using it for more than a month now. Has a very pleasant smell and leaves the skin magically supple. All that dreamy stuff is true. But the basic purpose of a cleaner is to clean. No matter how much quantity you use and how much you try to massage your face with it, the dirt and grime doesn't come off. You will feel nice and delicate and then you go back and check with a little toner on a cotton ball, there will still be dirt on it. Boy, you could only use a cloth instead and you will still see dirt left over on your 'supple nice smelling' face. It's useless. Maybe an apt product for a posh homemaker who never leaves the four walls but not for the regular person. For what it costs, I'd get much better products in other brands which provide these additional 'features' in addition to performing its basic function - cleaning!",Reviewed in India on 17 October 2017,5 people found this helpful,,

Golden products in need of user friendly packaging,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love biotique products since they are really effective and their ingredients are natural..the only drawback is their packaging, firstly they all come in quite similar kind of bottles or small containers which tend to mix up very easily ,you have to look carefully or read what bottle you have picked up, every time you want to apply them, so I request the manufacturer to use different diffrent coloured or shaped bottles for their products so that user can easily recognize them without reading the labels, secondly the plastic bottles are not very handy,  squeezing out the right proportion almost becomes a task for ex.the morning nectar, bio dandelion serum, so I recommend some nice  squeeze tubes instead.",Reviewed in India on 15 April 2021,2 people found this helpful,,

BEWARE of this brand and their sunscreen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure how are companies like this even allowed to legally exist since their products are straight up lying to customers about what's in them.First, lets talk about the whole ""natural"" brand. They call themselves Ayurvedic and Organically Pure when in reality if you look at their ingredients list, they don't even reveal majority of their ingredients. Their ingredients list only reveal less than 20% of the ingredients that it contains, the remaining 80% are unknown. It's simple, if you have nothing to hide then you simply wouldn't hide it.Secondly, if you don't believe the above conjecture then lets talk about their Sunscreen and the scientific testing done on them. The Department of Consumer Affairs of India tested 12 different sunscreens and published a 9 page long study about their findings. In their study they found and I quote ""Biotique contains a negligible amount of SPF (2.01) against the claimed 30 – hence, it is not recommended.""So, they claim they have 30 SPF but the testing done on their product revealed that it barely had 2.01SPF in reality. How can anyone trust a brand who blatantly lies about such an important factor in their sunscreen?(Note • You can google ""the department of consumer affairs india sunscreen "" and read the above mentioned study yourself too.)Due to these reasons above, I've rated their products 1 star.",Reviewed in India on 2 April 2022,16 people found this helpful,,

good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"so i bought this shampoo after seeing a lot of complaints on how after using this product the hair becomes dry but i wanted to give it a try.. i had my first experience with the shampoo and ngl its really good. what i did was that before i used he shampoo i massaged my hair with oil. let it sit for 30 mins and then i washed it off with the shampoo. what happenes to my hair with most of the shampoos is that it complete removes all the oil from my heart and leaves it really dry. but this shampoo made my hair less greasy but at the same time left some moisture form the oil on my hair which i really like.for people who have really dry scalp and hair i recommened to use it after using some oil and dont shampoo your hair dailybut i am such a big fan of the fragrance. it has a really really strong fragrance of tulsi right after the use. but it gradually becomes less after some time . and i also noticed that the hair fall out was comparitively less.for people who have oily curly hair, i would say JUST GO FOR IT",Reviewed in India on 25 June 2021,6 people found this helpful,,

Good body wash,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the Biotique Bio Apricot Refreshing Body Wash for a couple of weeks now, and I must say, I am impressed. The first thing that struck me was the delightful apricot fragrance. It is refreshing and invigorating, leaving me feeling energized after every shower.The body wash lathers up nicely and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. It does not strip away the natural oils from my skin and provides long-lasting hydration, keeping it moisturized all day long.One of the things that I appreciate about this body wash is that it is free from harmful chemicals such as parabens and sulfates. It is 100% natural, making it safe and gentle on my skin.Overall, I would highly recommend the Biotique Bio Apricot Refreshing Body Wash to anyone looking for a natural and refreshing body wash that provides hydration and leaves the skin feeling soft and supple. It is definitely a must-try!",Reviewed in India on 20 February 2023,,,

Worth a try,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So, i've used two bottles of this body wash already. First of all the fragrance is amazing but doesn't last more than 30 mins. Secondly you can still feel the soap after rubbing. You will have to use loafa to make foam, but it's an average product to give it a try  because it doesn't contain any paraben and it's safe to use.",Reviewed in India on 12 July 2021,,,
Worth regular use,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Biotique product - which means high standards and with the some of the pleasantest of fragrances.Content includes wild turmeric/haldi and so this is the only one I opt for when there're any skin issues like at present it's that Feb winter to summer transition climate when all that soaps & certain other body washes do is to make skin more dry & itchy - Biotique apricot bodywash is very soft on the skin, probably as it has haldi/turmeric and also as it claims to have zero soap content i.e. natural soapnuts (isn't it called shikakai?!) in it does the 'cleaning job'. Have been using it for many years now & is one of the favorite body washes.Tip to make the bottle last longer is to use a loofah to bubble up a squeeze of the body wash mixed with little water & use for whole body. Direct application, without loofah, though not harmful (do use it straight, when skin if so dry that even loofah hurts), might end up affecting our 'pockets' badly :-)Pros: A few months ago, 210ml used to cost 180rs, now 190ml costs as much - well, inflation probably! Some sellers at Amazon gives a little off the MRP though.Secondly I think Biotique goes for bio technology to replicate nature-similar substances and from an Ayurvedic perspective it may not be as all-natural as say some of the local cottage industry products. The quality of Biotique products are way higher than most cottage industry products & so are the fragrances they employ - very subtle, soft & pleasant - which should offset any drawbacks there, if at all, from a layman point of view.",Reviewed in India on 6 February 2016,12 people found this helpful,,

Good body wash,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a big fan of Biotique products. So I tried this body wash. It's really refreshing and doesn't dry out my skin especially during winters.

Also the packing is a bit cumbersome. When you are halfway through the bottle, taking the product out is a task.",Reviewed in India on 7 March 2020,,,

Review after a week of usage - will not recommend,2.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this product after doing necessary analysis and investigation including its natural ingredients and its soap free. I think i need to sharpen my analysis skills( may be this is my only experience with the product)Packaging and delivery : Well and goodProduct Pricing :Very goodNegative:The product performance.The product on first use itself didn't find befitting me or my skin, which is slight on dry side. I felt little irritation and ignoring the non lathering nature as its soap free, but felt its made up of some harmful chemical which isnt good for my skin. I am afraid to use it now. always when i use it i feel irritation and the smell is pungent which fades in a while, agree there is some cleaning effect on this.From personal perspective i will not recommend the product, even till date i wont believe its natural and organic - which creates dryness and irritation on skin after ever usage.If the manufacturer is seeing this message, request to communicate me the ingredients used is same as they claim on amazon and there are no chemicals added.Still i wonder will any natural product leaves this much dryness on skin along with irritation.... not sure.. extremely unhappy and disappointed.",Reviewed in India on 12 October 2019,9 people found this helpful,,

Bad and Harsh Product,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased 2 bottles with a lot of hope after reading so many positive review here. Liked it in the first 2 uses but soon itching started on the skin. It claims to be soap free but ironically soap free does not mean sulphates free. It definitely has sulphates. My skin is highly sensitive to sulphates and I had the same itching, redness and dryness as I get from a harsh sulphates based product. To add to that, thinking of it to be mild, I even used it on my head instead of shampoo and within 2-3 uses got such severe itching that took 2 months to heal. Was using for my kid but have now stopped using it. If you have sensitive dry skin, don't buy it. Eventually it would make the skin scratchy and itchy. Most of the people reviewing it here are those who are used to using normal commercial products and hence for them it is something good and nice. Use your own judgement.",Reviewed in India on 9 December 2016,4 people found this helpful,,

Very mild; does not cause itching,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Forest essential shampoos rated in order of cleansing strength:Bhringaraj & Shikakai (mild) < Jalapatti & Brahmi < Amla, Honey & Mulethi (harsh)If you use more viscous hair oils buy either Amla or Jalapatti shampoo.If you use light hair oils buy Bhringaraj or Jalapatti shampoo.I was utterly confused between all the variants even after reading multiple reviews so ended up purchasing 50ml of all three together. Now I use these on rotational basis.Tested all of them coupled with Kama ayurveda Bhringraj oil and all three of them were able to get rid of oil in 2 washes ( even the mildest variant). Though Amla ended up drying my hairs.Hairfall: Normal hairfall...did not notice shampoo induced hairfall. If you have shampoo induced hairfall this brand may come to rescue but like any other shampoo it wont do miracles. My scalp itches severely with any chemical laden shampoo...luckily all three variants did not cause this issue.Is it overpriced? Yes, it is.

Very mild; does not cause itching,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Forest essential shampoos rated in order of cleansing strength:Bhringaraj & Shikakai (mild) < Jalapatti & Brahmi < Amla, Honey & Mulethi (harsh)If you use more viscous hair oils buy either Amla or Jalapatti shampoo.If you use light hair oils buy Bhringaraj or Jalapatti shampoo.I was utterly confused between all the variants even after reading multiple reviews so ended up purchasing 50ml of all three together. Now I use these on rotational basis.Tested all of them coupled with Kama ayurveda Bhringraj oil and all three of them were able to get rid of oil in 2 washes ( even the mildest variant). Though Amla ended up drying my hairs.Hairfall: Normal hairfall...did not notice shampoo induced hairfall. If you have shampoo induced hairfall this brand may come to rescue but like any other shampoo it wont do miracles. My scalp itches severely with any chemical laden shampoo...luckily all three variants did not cause this issue.Is it overpriced? Yes, it is.

Stopped the boils on my scalp.,5.0 out of 5 stars,As i live in a humid climate due to sweat etc i would get scalp boils. Commercial shampoos with sls would make the situation worse.So now i wash my hair twice a week. I make sure to oil it. I use a mix of herbal Hair oil with the body shop tea tree oil few drops added to it. Then i let it sit for two hours. Then double cleanse (wash it twice) with the forest essentials shampoo and conditioner.Sometimes i finish the cleanse with an apple cider vinegar wash. This combo has made sure my scalp is not dry and itchy at the same time the boils have also gone.,Reviewed in India on 10 March 2023,,,
Best Ayurvedic Shampoo for Men,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife has ordered this shampoo, so I thought to use it. I have hereditary problem of hair loss. So I can only use ayurvedic.

Harshest of the three variants; works well with oil,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Forest essential shampoos rated in order of cleansing strength:Bhringaraj & Shikakai (mild) < Jalapatti & Brahmi < Amla, Honey & Mulethi (harsh)If you use more viscous hair oils buy either Amla or Jalapatti shampoo.If you use light hair oils buy Bhringaraj or Jalapatti shampoo.I was utterly confused between all the variants even after reading multiple reviews so ended up purchasing 50ml of all three together. Now I use these on rotational basis.Tested all of them coupled with Kama ayurveda Bhringraj oil and all three of them were able to get rid of oil in 2 washes ( even the mildest variant). Obviously the quantity of shampoo used varies. Amla cleans hair with minimal amount but ends up drying hairs a bit.Hairfall: Normal hairfall...did not notice shampoo induced hairfall. If you have shampoo induced hairfall this brand may come to rescue but like any other shampoo it wont do miracles. My scalp itches severely with any chemical laden shampoo...luckily all three variants did not cause this issue.Is it overpriced? Yes, it is. For that matter all forest essentials products are.Still confused? Maybe buy all three in 50ml...either you will love them or save yourself from committing to a bigger bottle.As for me...I find them above average and as long as they don't itch my scalp will continue investing.Amla variant: You will have to pair this with oil and hair mask/conditioner/ serum. Don't do that mistake of using it without oil application otherwise it will dry your hair immensely. Personally this is my least preferred shampoo out of three variants.",Reviewed in India on 16 August 2020,46 people found this helpful,,

Loving it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just got this recently and completely in love with it. I have oily scalp with dry ends and months of using an sls shampoo for oily hair had left my hair very frizzy and I decided to go for these herbal ones.

I used the shampoo on non oiled hair and it leathers well for a herbal shampoo. The lovely mild fragrance it has lingers in the hair for so long!

It's a great product,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used it for approx 5 months ...it's a damn good for face.it just improve your skin .you can't imagine.one flaw is that of this face wash is it doesn't remove oil from your face but it gives brightness to your face.,Reviewed in India on 15 June 2022,,,
Good 👍,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all tha delivery was on time and the product came with well packed and sealed and it has expiry date till 04/2022 and I have purchased this product from cloudtail retailer on Amazon.Now coming to the forest essential delicate facial cleanser, it's just ok product. I didn't find anything worth spending 1250 rs for this. There is much more better option in the market for cheaper price.  For one time purchase it's good and am not going to buy this again by wasting 1250rs. And this my personal opinion . If you want to try I would like to suggest go for 50ml rather than buying 200ml.And  my rating is completely based on how the product came to me, expiry date, packaging etc.",Reviewed in India on 29 July 2020,,,

"A bit pricey, but little goes long way...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the small bottle. Its fragrance is mild, but heavenly.. Just like every forest essentials product, smell takes over.It is sensitive on skin, the name says it all.. gently cleanses, no breakouts from using it. but only drawback is even with saffron and honey, it doesn't improve the skin tone. Definitely not a whitening face wash. It surely does brightens up the face for an hour or two.

Haven’t had acne/pimples since 6months now!

I haven’t had a breakout of acne/pimples since Jan’20 which otherwise I had every month! Very refreshing and light on the skin, I use it daily, and a small amount works wonders! I keep switching between this one and rose honey lemon one from the same brand. A small bottle lasts me months, may be because I mostly use it once a day only. Have tried all herbal and non herbal brands(Indian and Foreign) but nothing has helped me to keep a tight check on pimples/clear skin as Forest Essentials Face Cleanser! Go for it.

"Expensive, fragrant, good for dry skin, might have to use more than once for oily.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly, the cleanser comes in a plastic bottle and not glass. Second, the fragrance is amazing! It feels heavenly and luxurious. Third, it doesn't strip your skin of oils, it's mild but other than the fragrance the actual 'cleansing' experience isn't that great. Feels like rinsing oily skin with water, then a rubbery feel. You might have to use it twice if your skin is oily. After patting your skin dry, it feels good, the fragrance specially stays on for so long.❤️ The price for such quantity is quite high.",Reviewed in India on 12 August 2020,4 people found this helpful,,

Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is really great, but unfortunately I received the other variant which is for dry/normal skin.This is my usual face wash though. It's best for oily skin! Wet your face with warm water, and take 2 pumps and use circular motion to cleanse. Don't expect a lot of lather, it's a good thing it doesn't lather much, but it cleanses really well.I sure wish Forest Essentials products had better packaging. The bottle itself is alright, but the top keeps coming off. NOT FOR TRAVELLING! :-/ WE NEED BETTER DESIGNED BOTTLES.

Hello to soft skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,This face cleanser is a glorified face wash and not a makeup remover.But I still love it.You're supposed to use it on a damp face.Be careful and take only a teeny tiny bit.It won't lather.And the effect(skin so soft that I can't resist touching it again and again) will be noticeable only after using it consistently for 3-4 days.Stop using it for a couple of days and then it is bye bye soft skin.It doesn't do a single blessed thing about blemishes.But then I had zero expectations about that.I haven't noticed any glow either.The fragrance is heavenly! It is so subtle and is a blessing to people who can't stand strong perfumes.And the pump is so convenient.,Reviewed in India on 22 September 2016,2 people found this helpful,,

Deception and Forest Essentials are Synonyms,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The nozzles on all their bottles are 5 out of 10 times either broken or LEAKY.I have managed to purchase 75% of all of their products — minus the soaps, body oils, hair oils and dusting powders (because who even pays a fortune for your regular organic soap/oil that I can whip up at home! Or better yet, get an excellent alternative elsewhere!)Anyhow, I mailed them to ask for the ingredients list of certain products because they are super secretive about what goes into their “all natural” range of skincare. What did I find?Nothing special.They lie to the customers (foreign customers) and run on deception. For example: NARANGI IS ORANGE!Now, the ingredients list would have English names and then there’s “narangi extract”, narangi peel powder, etc.(???)Why?!Let me tell you what I have figured from testing about 20-30 products of theirs:• flimsy packaging in the name of “reducing plastic”.• clever way of using the kind of spray nozzles that spray so much you’ll be done with the bottle before you start noticing a difference/change.(I have preferred to transfer them into a bottle of rose water from another brand, and that fixed the problem for me because I really like the panchpushp!)• The products aren’t all bad but they’re not anything special. The effect that makes you go wow wears off as your skin adapts to their products (tested this on a few skin types).• their room surround spray nozzles leak heavily. They have completely removed any seals from room sprays!!! They evaporate!!! Why would you risk having something be spilled by children or even adults with loose room spray nozzles!?I had to find a way to hold the lid in place along with the nozzle. Every time I open the nozzle there’s tonnes of evaporated spray + oils spilled onto the inside of the lid and on the spray nozzle.• complete cheapskates. I purchased ALL five of their ubtan range and each of them have just 1-2 at most 3 different ingredients which make them “unique” so you’re forced to purchase the others. The rest of the ingredients are the exact same or repeated!All in the name of profits, sales, and “luxurious Ayurveda”.• Some of their products like the orange and sandalwood moisturizer, quality and formulation are both sub par.• I hope we have all been familiarized with the fair and lovely scent? Their velvet silk cream moisturizer smells the exact same. A total ripoff! And super greasy (my humble apologies to the acne-prone / combination skin bearers).I speak from experience with blending, mixing, pounding and formulating my own skincare for years.I own (in total) over 70 essential + carrier oils and herbal tinctures + powdered products. I know what I’m talking about.It is when you purchase a set of all products from a range (like all 5 ubtan mixes they offer, or all of different rose spray, perfume and room spray etc) is when you realize how you’re being tricked by pretty packaging and some fake reviews (yes I said fake!)The website at least has 90% reviews that are not by real customers. Because who repetitively uses the title “Forest Essentials” over and over in a review, OR, who has the time to write the product name exactly as it is with certain reiterated vocabulary in each and every review?I mean, come on! *scoffs*The ojas balm smells like my mother‘s pain  relief oil that her Ayurvedic doctor blended for her. And it was not half as expensive as the one that’s sold.The only thing that really does knock the charts off is the date and lichee night cream. The only good skincare item.Oh and did I forget to mention? The Rose cardamom body spray, the rose surround spray and the rose perfume do not smell very different from each other?And the toners/hydrosol bottles too, leak when spraying. They don’t just spray a lot, they also leak! I have tried 3-4 of those bottles. It’s not just one defective product, as I too decided that it was, until every other bottle nozzle would do the same! I’m not paying 2k+ for pretty (read: cheap) packaging you know.And the mashobra honey face cleanser is a super mild version of this kashmir saffron cleanser with a couple extra ingredients tossed and taken off the list. Not much difference there.Still want to go ahead and get their products? Sure do, it’s everyone's prerogative to be associated with whoever or whatever. One may pay for the pretty packaging that’s defective I guess.And for the customer support? No. Just no.Someone (I do not wish to take any names) on support team via email, replies to a part of your message and not all of it. Deliberate effort to avoid replying to a part of a message multiple times. (PS:) I tried asking from separate emails (different timelines) just to check if it’s just me or are they really trying to avoid certain questions (and yes they are).It is as though they are trying to avoid giving out information even though, I, as a customer am entitled to that information. What I mean is, the questions weren’t wrong or avoidable either. As a customer you have the right to know what ingredients go in a product whether chemical or not. This should not be too difficult to answer. I have not completely knocked chemicals off my skincare just yet, so it does not make a difference to me to know if it’s completely ‘natural’ or not! I just want to know.They pride themselves on absolutely nothing but deception and ornate packaging. I laugh.I am not surprised that we are being cheated the way that we are because well, who runs on integrity these days, deceit is the new black, deception is the fuel.Also, ONLY IF this particular review is beneficial to you or to your family, then please do share (screenshot, perhaps). Because my review was taken down last time (sorry the product I reviewed was taken down to keep this review from showing, and so my review went down with it)Edited to add: If you purchase here, you’ll receive low-quality stock that smells old/rancid because they think rejects can be sold here and they won’t be questioned about it. You will not find the stuff they sell in their retail outlets here because they can get away with it here.Hope this helps someone!PS: If this review does not appear as verified purchase then please rest assured that I only review products I own.

The amazing refreshing smell,4.0 out of 5 stars,I almost never repeat face washes unless and until it really impresses me. I  started with pond’s and pears face wash ( I used to buy them with my pocket money since the concept of face washes was new and my Mumma thought it as another one of my crazy expenses.)PROS:The fact that it is chemical free!!!!The amazing refreshing smell.Gives an instant glow to my face.I have noticed a teeny reduction of my gigantic pores after I have started using it but I am also using Fabindia rose water so i guess it is a joined effort of both the products.It is suitable for all skin types..even sensitive skin.A very small quantity is required for one wash hence it will last me a loong time.Does not dry my skin. Although I have combination skin I do not like face washes that strip my face of all the moisture.CONSI cannot think of anything except the price.But I am willing to spend this much on a fab product like this.And since it is too mild i mean if you have travelled and have all that grime and dust on your face..i feel using this face wash only wont give you a squeaky clean feel because it lathers very less. I therefore don’t use it after I come home in the evening after office.,Reviewed in India on 14 July 2017,11 people found this helpful,,

I didn't find anything worth spending 1250 rs for this. There is much more better option in the market for cheaper price.  For one time purchase it's good and am not going to buy this again by wasting 1250rs. And this my personal opinion .

I keep switching between this one and rose honey lemon one from the same brand. A small bottle lasts me months, may be because I mostly use it once a day only.

Hello to soft skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,This face cleanser is a glorified face wash and not a makeup remover.But I still love it.You're supposed to use it on a damp face.Be careful and take only a teeny tiny bit.It won't lather.And the effect(skin so soft that I can't resist touching it again and again) will be noticeable only after using it consistently for 3-4 days.Stop using it for a couple of days and then it is bye bye soft skin.It doesn't do a single blessed thing about blemishes.But then I had zero expectations about that.I haven't noticed any glow either.The fragrance is heavenly! It is so subtle and is a blessing to people who can't stand strong perfumes.And the pump is so convenient.,Reviewed in India on 22 September 2016,2 people found this helpful,,

Deception and Forest Essentials are Synonyms,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The nozzles on all their bottles are 5 out of 10 times either broken or LEAKY.I have managed to purchase 75% of all of their products — minus the soaps, body oils, hair oils and dusting powders (because who even pays a fortune for your regular organic soap/oil that I can whip up at home! Or better yet, get an excellent alternative elsewhere!)Anyhow, I mailed them to ask for the ingredients list of certain products because they are super secretive about what goes into their “all natural” range of skincare. What did I find?Nothing special.They lie to the customers (foreign customers) and run on deception. For example: NARANGI IS ORANGE!Now, the ingredients list would have English names and then there’s “narangi extract”, narangi peel powder, etc.(???)Why?!Let me tell you what I have figured from testing about 20-30 products of theirs:• flimsy packaging in the name of “reducing plastic”.• clever way of using the kind of spray nozzles that spray so much you’ll be done with the bottle before you start noticing a difference/change.(I have preferred to transfer them into a bottle of rose water from another brand, and that fixed the problem for me because I really like the panchpushp!)• The products aren’t all bad but they’re not anything special. The effect that makes you go wow wears off as your skin adapts to their products (tested this on a few skin types).• their room surround spray nozzles leak heavily. They have completely removed any seals from room sprays!!! They evaporate!!! Why would you risk having something be spilled by children or even adults with loose room spray nozzles!?I had to find a way to hold the lid in place along with the nozzle. Every time I open the nozzle there’s tonnes of evaporated spray + oils spilled onto the inside of the lid and on the spray nozzle.• complete cheapskates. I purchased ALL five of their ubtan range and each of them have just 1-2 at most 3 different ingredients which make them “unique” so you’re forced to purchase the others. The rest of the ingredients are the exact same or repeated!All in the name of profits, sales, and “luxurious Ayurveda”.• Some of their products like the orange and sandalwood moisturizer, quality and formulation are both sub par.• I hope we have all been familiarized with the fair and lovely scent? Their velvet silk cream moisturizer smells the exact same. A total ripoff! And super greasy (my humble apologies to the acne-prone / combination skin bearers).I speak from experience with blending, mixing, pounding and formulating my own skincare for years.I own (in total) over 70 essential + carrier oils and herbal tinctures + powdered products. I know what I’m talking about.It is when you purchase a set of all products from a range (like all 5 ubtan mixes they offer, or all of different rose spray, perfume and room spray etc) is when you realize how you’re being tricked by pretty packaging and some fake reviews (yes I said fake!)The website at least has 90% reviews that are not by real customers. Because who repetitively uses the title “Forest Essentials” over and over in a review, OR, who has the time to write the product name exactly as it is with certain reiterated vocabulary in each and every review?I mean, come on! *scoffs*The ojas balm smells like my mother‘s pain  relief oil that her Ayurvedic doctor blended for her. And it was not half as expensive as the one that’s sold.The only thing that really does knock the charts off is the date and lichee night cream. The only good skincare item.Oh and did I forget to mention? The Rose cardamom body spray, the rose surround spray and the rose perfume do not smell very different from each other?And the toners/hydrosol bottles too, leak when spraying. They don’t just spray a lot, they also leak! I have tried 3-4 of those bottles. It’s not just one defective product, as I too decided that it was, until every other bottle nozzle would do the same! I’m not paying 2k+ for pretty (read: cheap) packaging you know.And the mashobra honey face cleanser is a super mild version of this kashmir saffron cleanser with a couple extra ingredients tossed and taken off the list. Not much difference there.Still want to go ahead and get their products? Sure do, it’s everyone's prerogative to be associated with whoever or whatever. One may pay for the pretty packaging that’s defective I guess.And for the customer support? No. Just no.Someone (I do not wish to take any names) on support team via email, replies to a part of your message and not all of it. Deliberate effort to avoid replying to a part of a message multiple times. (PS:) I tried asking from separate emails (different timelines) just to check if it’s just me or are they really trying to avoid certain questions (and yes they are).It is as though they are trying to avoid giving out information even though, I, as a customer am entitled to that information. What I mean is, the questions weren’t wrong or avoidable either. As a customer you have the right to know what ingredients go in a product whether chemical or not. This should not be too difficult to answer. I have not completely knocked chemicals off my skincare just yet, so it does not make a difference to me to know if it’s completely ‘natural’ or not! I just want to know.They pride themselves on absolutely nothing but deception and ornate packaging. I laugh.I am not surprised that we are being cheated the way that we are because well, who runs on integrity these days, deceit is the new black, deception is the fuel.Also, ONLY IF this particular review is beneficial to you or to your family, then please do share (screenshot, perhaps). Because my review was taken down last time (sorry the product I reviewed was taken down to keep this review from showing, and so my review went down with it)Edited to add: If you purchase here, you’ll receive low-quality stock that smells old/rancid because they think rejects can be sold here and they won’t be questioned about it. You will not find the stuff they sell in their retail outlets here because they can get away with it here.Hope this helps someone!PS: If this review does not appear as verified purchase then please rest assured that I only review products I own.

I  started with pond’s and pears face wash ( I used to buy them with my pocket money since the concept of face washes was new and my Mumma thought it as another one of my crazy expenses.)PROS:The fact that it is chemical free!!!!The amazing refreshing smell.Gives an instant glow to my face.I have noticed a teeny reduction of my gigantic pores after I have started using it but I am also using Fabindia rose water so i guess it is a joined effort of both the products.It is suitable for all skin types..even sensitive skin.A very small quantity is required for one wash hence it will last me a loong time.Does not dry my skin. Although I have combination skin I do not like face washes that strip my face of all the moisture.CONSI cannot think of anything except the price.But I am willing to spend this much on a fab product like this.And since it is too mild i mean if you have travelled and have all that grime and dust on your face..i feel using this face wash only wont give you a squeaky clean feel because it lathers very less. I therefore don’t use it after I come home in the evening after office.,Reviewed in India on 14 July 2017,11 people found this helpful,,

Not suitable for combination skin !!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Might be working for a lot of Indian women. But for my combination skin it didn’t work out well.

Does not dries up the skin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, it does not dries up the skin but  nothing other than that is out of the box, gives same results asordinary facewashesBut should try if you can afford.",Reviewed in India on 2 October 2022,,,
Average Results / Strong Rose scent / Review after using entire bottle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this delivered in March 2nd week and the bottle has almost come to end; I use it mostly once or max twice a day to wash my face - so lasted about 3-3.5 month for one person. You need very small quantity of it to wash.The face wash has strong rose scent - initially -  it is overpowering but you get used to it. No other notes are discernible except for rose.There is no visible change to face as such but it is not a drying face wash , i have combination skin and I did not notice any drying ; on contrary I feel it does not clear out oil on nose very well and I had use to charcoal nose -strip every week to remove white heads.Overall - my verdict is that it is a mild face wash with a slightly over powering rose scent ; the Neem & saffron face wash of same brand has better fragrance ( I have used that one as well) .  Also - it is not 100% chemical free just that it is a glycerin/honey based face wash. but this also contains Tochopheryl Acetate.Buy it - if you have money and extra sensitive skin ; otherwise do not expect any dramatic results for your skin.If my review has helped you - pls press helpful.",Reviewed in India on 27 July 2020,185 people found this helpful,,

Haven’t had Acne/Pimples since 6months! Wonder Wash!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was introduced to Forest Essentials facewash by a friend in Jan’20 and since then I have stuck to this brand of facewash only. I haven’t had a breakout of acne/pimples since Jan’20 which otherwise I had every month! Very refreshing and light on the skin, I use it daily, and a small amount works wonders! I keep switching between this one and saffron neem one from the same brand. A small bottle lasts me months, may be because I mostly use it once a day only. Have tried all herbal and non herbal brands(Indian and Foreign) but nothing has helped me to keep a tight check on pimples/clear skin as Forest Essentials Face Cleanser! Go for it.

It worked for me. As long as side effects is concerned..been using it for a year but never had any. It's a good buy :),Reviewed in India on 11 July 2020,One person found this helpful,,
Best facewash,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this for a few months now. I swear by this face wash. It's very gentle on your skin, has the right amount of lather and smells heavenly!

It may not be effective in removing heavy make up, which works fine for me.Given the fact that it lasts for a long time, the high price is ok.",Reviewed in India on 20 October 2020,,,

Horrible Product. Doesn't work at all,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible Product. Doesn't work at all. I have been using it for more than a month now. Has a very pleasant smell and leaves the skin magically supple. All that dreamy stuff is true. But the basic purpose of a cleaner is to clean. No matter how much quantity you use and how much you try to massage your face with it, the dirt and grime doesn't come off. You will feel nice and delicate and then you go back and check with a little toner on a cotton ball, there will still be dirt on it. Boy, you could only use a cloth instead and you will still see dirt left over on your 'supple nice smelling' face. It's useless. Maybe an apt product for a posh homemaker who never leaves the four walls but not for the regular person. For what it costs, I'd get much better products in other brands which provide these additional 'features' in addition to performing its basic function - cleaning!",Reviewed in India on 17 October 2017,5 people found this helpful,,

It's a great product,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used it for approx 5 months ...it's a damn good for face.it just improve your skin .you can't imagine.one flaw is that of this face wash is it doesn't remove oil from your face but it gives brightness to your face.,Reviewed in India on 15 June 2022,,,
Good 👍,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all tha delivery was on time and the product came with well packed and sealed and it has expiry date till 04/2022 and I have purchased this product from cloudtail retailer on Amazon.Now coming to the forest essential delicate facial cleanser, it's just ok product. I didn't find anything worth spending 1250 rs for this. There is much more better option in the market for cheaper price.  For one time purchase it's good and am not going to buy this again by wasting 1250rs. And this my personal opinion . If you want to try I would like to suggest go for 50ml rather than buying 200ml.And  my rating is completely based on how the product came to me, expiry date, packaging etc.",Reviewed in India on 29 July 2020,,,

Try it out,4.0 out of 5 stars,Those who have acne or pimple problems can use it but it depends from person to person. It was good for me but not that great. It best suited my sister's skin.

"A bit pricey, but little goes long way...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the small bottle. Its fragrance is mild, but heavenly.. Just like every forest essentials product, smell takes over.It is sensitive on skin, the name says it all.. gently cleanses, no breakouts from using it. but only drawback is even with saffron and honey, it doesn't improve the skin tone. Definitely not a whitening face wash. It surely does brightens up the face for an hour or two. That's enough for a face wash, I guess..",Reviewed in India on 5 October 2020,2 people found this helpful,,

Haven’t had acne/pimples since 6months now! Wonder Wash!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was introduced to Forest Essentials facewash by a friend in Jan’20 and since then I have stuck to this brand of facewash only. I haven’t had a breakout of acne/pimples since Jan’20 which otherwise I had every month! Very refreshing and light on the skin, I use it daily, and a small amount works wonders! I keep switching between this one and rose honey lemon one from the same brand. A small bottle lasts me months, may be because I mostly use it once a day only. Have tried all herbal and non herbal brands(Indian and Foreign) but nothing has helped me to keep a tight check on pimples/clear skin as Forest Essentials Face Cleanser! Go for it. Try with a small size to check your skin compatibility.",Reviewed in India on 12 August 2020,5 people found this helpful,,

Diluted with Water - destroyed a good product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first bought this product, I was in love with it due to its fragrance and quality. However, Forest Essential has diluted this product so much with water, its no longer a face wash but some water solution. you can use the small bottle only 3-4 times at best.

"Expensive, fragrant, good for dry skin, might have to use more than once for oily.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly, the cleanser comes in a plastic bottle and not glass. Second, the fragrance is amazing! It feels heavenly and luxurious. Third, it doesn't strip your skin of oils, it's mild but other than the fragrance the actual 'cleansing' experience isn't that great. Feels like rinsing oily skin with water, then a rubbery feel. You might have to use it twice if your skin is oily. After patting your skin dry, it feels good, the fragrance specially stays on for so long.❤️ The price for such quantity is quite high.",Reviewed in India on 12 August 2020,4 people found this helpful,,

Wet your face with warm water, and take 2 pumps and use circular motion to cleanse. Don't expect a lot of lather, it's a good thing it doesn't lather much, but it cleanses really well.I sure wish Forest Essentials products had better packaging.

Hello to soft skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,This face cleanser is a glorified face wash and not a makeup remover.But I still love it.You're supposed to use it on a damp face.Be careful and take only a teeny tiny bit.It won't lather.And the effect(skin so soft that I can't resist touching it again and again) will be noticeable only after using it consistently for 3-4 days.Stop using it for a couple of days and then it is bye bye soft skin.It doesn't do a single blessed thing about blemishes.But then I had zero expectations about that.I haven't noticed any glow either.The fragrance is heavenly! It is so subtle and is a blessing to people who can't stand strong perfumes.And the pump is so convenient.,Reviewed in India on 22 September 2016,2 people found this helpful,,

Deception and Forest Essentials are Synonyms,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The nozzles on all their bottles are 5 out of 10 times either broken or LEAKY.I have managed to purchase 75% of all of their products — minus the soaps, body oils, hair oils and dusting powders (because who even pays a fortune for your regular organic soap/oil that I can whip up at home! Or better yet, get an excellent alternative elsewhere!)Anyhow, I mailed them to ask for the ingredients list of certain products because they are super secretive about what goes into their “all natural” range of skincare. What did I find?Nothing special.They lie to the customers (foreign customers) and run on deception. For example: NARANGI IS ORANGE!Now, the ingredients list would have English names and then there’s “narangi extract”, narangi peel powder, etc.(???)Why?!Let me tell you what I have figured from testing about 20-30 products of theirs:• flimsy packaging in the name of “reducing plastic”.• clever way of using the kind of spray nozzles that spray so much you’ll be done with the bottle before you start noticing a difference/change.(I have preferred to transfer them into a bottle of rose water from another brand, and that fixed the problem for me because I really like the panchpushp!)• The products aren’t all bad but they’re not anything special. The effect that makes you go wow wears off as your skin adapts to their products (tested this on a few skin types).• their room surround spray nozzles leak heavily. They have completely removed any seals from room sprays!!! They evaporate!!! Why would you risk having something be spilled by children or even adults with loose room spray nozzles!?I had to find a way to hold the lid in place along with the nozzle. Every time I open the nozzle there’s tonnes of evaporated spray + oils spilled onto the inside of the lid and on the spray nozzle.• complete cheapskates. I purchased ALL five of their ubtan range and each of them have just 1-2 at most 3 different ingredients which make them “unique” so you’re forced to purchase the others. The rest of the ingredients are the exact same or repeated!All in the name of profits, sales, and “luxurious Ayurveda”.• Some of their products like the orange and sandalwood moisturizer, quality and formulation are both sub par.• I hope we have all been familiarized with the fair and lovely scent? Their velvet silk cream moisturizer smells the exact same. A total ripoff! And super greasy (my humble apologies to the acne-prone / combination skin bearers).I speak from experience with blending, mixing, pounding and formulating my own skincare for years.I own (in total) over 70 essential + carrier oils and herbal tinctures + powdered products. I know what I’m talking about.It is when you purchase a set of all products from a range (like all 5 ubtan mixes they offer, or all of different rose spray, perfume and room spray etc) is when you realize how you’re being tricked by pretty packaging and some fake reviews (yes I said fake!)The website at least has 90% reviews that are not by real customers. Because who repetitively uses the title “Forest Essentials” over and over in a review, OR, who has the time to write the product name exactly as it is with certain reiterated vocabulary in each and every review?I mean, come on! *scoffs*The ojas balm smells like my mother‘s pain  relief oil that her Ayurvedic doctor blended for her. And it was not half as expensive as the one that’s sold.The only thing that really does knock the charts off is the date and lichee night cream. The only good skincare item.Oh and did I forget to mention? The Rose cardamom body spray, the rose surround spray and the rose perfume do not smell very different from each other?And the toners/hydrosol bottles too, leak when spraying. They don’t just spray a lot, they also leak! I have tried 3-4 of those bottles. It’s not just one defective product, as I too decided that it was, until every other bottle nozzle would do the same! I’m not paying 2k+ for pretty (read: cheap) packaging you know.And the mashobra honey face cleanser is a super mild version of this kashmir saffron cleanser with a couple extra ingredients tossed and taken off the list. Not much difference there.Still want to go ahead and get their products? Sure do, it’s everyone's prerogative to be associated with whoever or whatever. One may pay for the pretty packaging that’s defective I guess.And for the customer support? No. Just no.Someone (I do not wish to take any names) on support team via email, replies to a part of your message and not all of it. Deliberate effort to avoid replying to a part of a message multiple times. (PS:) I tried asking from separate emails (different timelines) just to check if it’s just me or are they really trying to avoid certain questions (and yes they are).It is as though they are trying to avoid giving out information even though, I, as a customer am entitled to that information. What I mean is, the questions weren’t wrong or avoidable either. As a customer you have the right to know what ingredients go in a product whether chemical or not. This should not be too difficult to answer. I have not completely knocked chemicals off my skincare just yet, so it does not make a difference to me to know if it’s completely ‘natural’ or not! I just want to know.They pride themselves on absolutely nothing but deception and ornate packaging. I laugh.I am not surprised that we are being cheated the way that we are because well, who runs on integrity these days, deceit is the new black, deception is the fuel.Also, ONLY IF this particular review is beneficial to you or to your family, then please do share (screenshot, perhaps). Because my review was taken down last time (sorry the product I reviewed was taken down to keep this review from showing, and so my review went down with it)Edited to add: If you purchase here, you’ll receive low-quality stock that smells old/rancid because they think rejects can be sold here and they won’t be questioned about it. You will not find the stuff they sell in their retail outlets here because they can get away with it here.Hope this helps someone!PS: If this review does not appear as verified purchase then please rest assured that I only review products I own. For this product may not have been purchased from amazon but an alternate account, received as a sample, a gift or may have been purchased in store.",Reviewed in India on 12 January 2020,350 people found this helpful,,

There was no response to it. In my grievance I had even mentioned that the same thing had happened with me when I had bought another Forest Essential product almost a year ago and contacted customer support team in vain.So in my experience Forest Essential has failed me twice consistently and without any regret or remorse.This was clearly my last purchase from Forest Essentials.",Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,One person found this helpful,,

The amazing refreshing smell,4.0 out of 5 stars,I almost never repeat face washes unless and until it really impresses me. I  started with pond’s and pears face wash ( I used to buy them with my pocket money since the concept of face washes was new and my Mumma thought it as another one of my crazy expenses.)PROS:The fact that it is chemical free!!!!The amazing refreshing smell.Gives an instant glow to my face.I have noticed a teeny reduction of my gigantic pores after I have started using it but I am also using Fabindia rose water so i guess it is a joined effort of both the products.It is suitable for all skin types..even sensitive skin.A very small quantity is required for one wash hence it will last me a loong time.Does not dry my skin. Although I have combination skin I do not like face washes that strip my face of all the moisture.CONSI cannot think of anything except the price.But I am willing to spend this much on a fab product like this.And since it is too mild i mean if you have travelled and have all that grime and dust on your face..i feel using this face wash only wont give you a squeaky clean feel because it lathers very less. I therefore don’t use it after I come home in the evening after office.,Reviewed in India on 14 July 2017,11 people found this helpful,,

Does not dries up the skin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, it does not dries up the skin but  nothing other than that is out of the box, gives same results asordinary facewashesBut should try if you can afford.",Reviewed in India on 2 October 2022,,,
Average Results / Strong Rose scent / Review after using entire bottle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this delivered in March 2nd week and the bottle has almost come to end; I use it mostly once or max twice a day to wash my face - so lasted about 3-3.5 month for one person. You need very small quantity of it to wash.The face wash has strong rose scent - initially -  it is overpowering but you get used to it. No other notes are discernible except for rose.There is no visible change to face as such but it is not a drying face wash , i have combination skin and I did not notice any drying ; on contrary I feel it does not clear out oil on nose very well and I had use to charcoal nose -strip every week to remove white heads.Overall - my verdict is that it is a mild face wash with a slightly over powering rose scent ; the Neem & saffron face wash of same brand has better fragrance ( I have used that one as well) .  Also - it is not 100% chemical free just that it is a glycerin/honey based face wash. but this also contains Tochopheryl Acetate.Buy it - if you have money and extra sensitive skin ; otherwise do not expect any dramatic results for your skin.If my review has helped you - pls press helpful.",Reviewed in India on 27 July 2020,185 people found this helpful,,

Ok,4.0 out of 5 stars,I do not like the new packaging. It has a bigger opening due to which a large amount of liquid comes out. I think there is some problem with the cap too.

Haven’t had Acne/Pimples since 6months! Wonder Wash!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was introduced to Forest Essentials facewash by a friend in Jan’20 and since then I have stuck to this brand of facewash only. I haven’t had a breakout of acne/pimples since Jan’20 which otherwise I had every month! Very refreshing and light on the skin, I use it daily, and a small amount works wonders! I keep switching between this one and saffron neem one from the same brand. A small bottle lasts me months, may be because I mostly use it once a day only. Have tried all herbal and non herbal brands(Indian and Foreign) but nothing has helped me to keep a tight check on pimples/clear skin as Forest Essentials Face Cleanser! Go for it.

Horrible Product. Doesn't work at all,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible Product. Doesn't work at all. I have been using it for more than a month now. Has a very pleasant smell and leaves the skin magically supple. All that dreamy stuff is true. But the basic purpose of a cleaner is to clean. No matter how much quantity you use and how much you try to massage your face with it, the dirt and grime doesn't come off. You will feel nice and delicate and then you go back and check with a little toner on a cotton ball, there will still be dirt on it. Boy, you could only use a cloth instead and you will still see dirt left over on your 'supple nice smelling' face. It's useless. Maybe an apt product for a posh homemaker who never leaves the four walls but not for the regular person. For what it costs, I'd get much better products in other brands which provide these additional 'features' in addition to performing its basic function - cleaning!",Reviewed in India on 17 October 2017,5 people found this helpful,,

Good for problematic skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am currently using my 3rd bottle. My skin type is sensitive-dry-acne prone. I'm never going back to another face wash. This one's gentle but is strong enough to remove cleansing balms/oils from face. Has a spa like smell which i love. One pump is usually enough for me to wash my face and lathers pretty well for a 100% certified organic face wash. Thank you JC,Reviewed in India on 15 December 2020,,,
"Gentle, Effective Face Wash; Smells Like an Exotic Fruit Market",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've experimented with a lot of different face washes; my sensitive skin requires something gentle, and I prefer cleansers that rinse cleanly. (Some ""moisturizing"" formulas leave a filmy layer behind on my face.) This Juicy Chemistry face wash meets both of my requirements; it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin in the slightest, and even though its ingredients contain several different oils, they don't leave a greasy or waxy film behind.As some other reviewers have noted, this face wash has a rather unusual scent; it reminded me of the aromas of ripe fruits in the outdoor markets of French Polynesia or South Asia.

Very Strong Floral Scent,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the way Juicy Chemistry's face wash feels. It has a smooth, silky texture and doesn't leave my skin dry. The ingredients are great.

Good Face Wash But Peculiar Scent!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"In my opinion, this face wash is just okay. It does lather a little, and my face actually felt squeaky clean.

For Those Who Prefer An Oil Based Cleanser,3.0 out of 5 stars,"An okay facial cleanser but for those who prefer a nice oil based cleanser. Oil dissolves and helps to remove other oils you need replacing in order to get your face nice and clean without stripping it of essential oils. It works and is something that I prefer to use between other cleansers. Like my shampoos, I like to swap around with my cleansers to get the best that each has to offer. This is a good cleanser when I want something that's not so stripping or too thick with ceramides and such.Honestly, this is something that I would expect to pick up in a health food store. It just has that certain something that you would expect to find there. Different, natural and effective but won't necessarily appeal to the general public. Partly because of the scent. A bit strong and not really something most would consider pleasant. Not really bad though either. Have to admit that I do get a kick out of using something with frankincense around Christmas time.

For Those Who Prefer An Oil Based Cleanser,3.0 out of 5 stars,"An okay facial cleanser but for those who prefer a nice oil based cleanser. Oil dissolves and helps to remove other oils you need replacing in order to get your face nice and clean without stripping it of essential oils. It works and is something that I prefer to use between other cleansers. Like my shampoos, I like to swap around with my cleansers to get the best that each has to offer. This is a good cleanser when I want something that's not so stripping or too thick with ceramides and such.Honestly, this is something that I would expect to pick up in a health food store. It just has that certain something that you would expect to find there. Different, natural and effective but won't necessarily appeal to the general public. Partly because of the scent. A bit strong and not really something most would consider pleasant. Not really bad though either. Have to admit that I do get a kick out of using something with frankincense around Christmas time.

Good for problematic skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am currently using my 3rd bottle. My skin type is sensitive-dry-acne prone. I'm never going back to another face wash.

"Gentle, Effective Face Wash; Smells Like an Exotic Fruit Market",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've experimented with a lot of different face washes; my sensitive skin requires something gentle, and I prefer cleansers that rinse cleanly. (Some ""moisturizing"" formulas leave a filmy layer behind on my face.) This Juicy Chemistry face wash meets both of my requirements; it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin in the slightest, and even though its ingredients contain several different oils, they don't leave a greasy or waxy film behind.As some other reviewers have noted, this face wash has a rather unusual scent; it reminded me of the aromas of ripe fruits in the outdoor markets of French Polynesia or South Asia. (Perhaps that's not surprising, considering this  cleanser is made in India.) As a vegetarian, the fact that this product is cruelty-free, vegan, organic, and 100% natural is important to me.Overall, I'm really pleased with this Juicy Chemistry Tamanu, Kakadu Plum & Frankincense Organic Face Wash, and I feel it's a very good value for the price. The only reason I rated it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it has a somewhat runny consistency; if you're not careful, the cleanser may leak between your fingers before you have a chance to apply it to your face.

Good for problematic skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am currently using my 3rd bottle. My skin type is sensitive-dry-acne prone. I'm never going back to another face wash.

"Gentle, Effective Face Wash; Smells Like an Exotic Fruit Market",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've experimented with a lot of different face washes; my sensitive skin requires something gentle, and I prefer cleansers that rinse cleanly.

This Juicy Chemistry face wash meets both of my requirements; it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin in the slightest, and even though its ingredients contain several different oils, they don't leave a greasy or waxy film behind.As some other reviewers have noted, this face wash has a rather unusual scent; it reminded me of the aromas of ripe fruits in the outdoor markets of French Polynesia or South Asia.

Horrible news,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had some expectations - if not a lot, that at least this would bring a little glow, and would improve complexion just a little. It is absolutely pathetic.

Thirdly - it gives an extremely weird cakey look - whitish - after some time - which is worse that even you natural skin. Lastly - it neither illuminates the skin even a bit not hide any blemishes to even 1%.I would say spare yourself the horror and Don’t buy this. I actually want a refund for this stupid product which I don’t know why is exorbitantly charged. I want my money back. I have no clue why did they charge approx 1000 rupees for a perfectly useless product,Also - if you are the one who like me want a totally toxin free product made in India as well as something that actually WORKS - please write in comments about products that work.

Second skin!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical on buying this shade, I bought it as a rough guess after seeing YouTube reviews etc but it turned out to be a perfect match. I use it over arata vitamin C moisturiser - amazing light gel moisturizer.What I like about this product:1. tint matches very well with light neutral (south Indian) skin tone.2. Iv dry skin with acne, it didn’t cause break outs.3. Gives moderate coverage, iv old acne scars, a few enlarged pores, but there’s not enough coverage to hide red active acne. Overall it looks natural4. It looks very natural if u find your exact skin tone match, people don’t know you have allied anything on ur face.5. Use it on a moisturizer, let the moisturizer absorb into ur skin and then apply this, it won’t flake at all.6. Very safe and ethical product. No “harmful” chemicals, no animal fat, no animal testing.7. Need small quantity to give enough coverage.",Reviewed in India on 28 October 2022,3 people found this helpful,,

Just a tinted moisturizer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a tinted moisturizer so don't expect coverage, it gives a subtle brightening and glow effect for instance if you ever used Garnier bb cream, the effect is same. I purchased natural shade for my medium fair skin and it's ok for me. The most satisfying thing for me was that I'm not applying pure chemical over my skin so I'm happy that I can use it without worrying about skin damage so price is justified to me. Will try their beige shade next time as I found natural shade a little whitish for my yellow tonned skin. It also had mild tingling after application maybe because of herbs.",Reviewed in India on 22 December 2021,3 people found this helpful,,

HOLY TRIFECTA OF HAIRCARE INGREDIENTS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have pretty dry 3B curly hair with split ends and a dandruff prone scalp that makes my hairfall worse and my hair growth slow. I tried many masks in the Indian market like Mamaearth's Argan Oil Mask and TRESemme's Keratin Hair Mask. While both of those were good for softening and adding some shine to my curls, they weren't so good at fighting the main issues of my scalp. However, this Just Herbs mask has done just that! I have always loved Just Herbs as a brand and tried it's other wonderful products, so I already had pretty high expectations from this product. The three main ingredients of amla, bhringraj, and shankhpushpi did wonders for my hair after a month of use (once a week for 4 weeks). The amla helped make my hair soft and smooth as well as increased hair growth a little. The bhringraj helped reduce my dandruff for a smoother, less flakier scalp, while the shankhpushpi helped reduce my hairfall. All in all, I have never found a product that helps solve all my hair problems at once before trying out this mask! I recommend it to people of all hair types, since I will also definitely be repurchasing this product.",Reviewed in India on 23 March 2022,2 people found this helpful,,

HOLY TRIFECTA OF HAIRCARE INGREDIENTS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have pretty dry 3B curly hair with split ends and a dandruff prone scalp that makes my hairfall worse and my hair growth slow. I tried many masks in the Indian market like Mamaearth's Argan Oil Mask and TRESemme's Keratin Hair Mask. While both of those were good for softening and adding some shine to my curls, they weren't so good at fighting the main issues of my scalp. However, this Just Herbs mask has done just that! I have always loved Just Herbs as a brand and tried it's other wonderful products, so I already had pretty high expectations from this product. The three main ingredients of amla, bhringraj, and shankhpushpi did wonders for my hair after a month of use (once a week for 4 weeks). The amla helped make my hair soft and smooth as well as increased hair growth a little. The bhringraj helped reduce my dandruff for a smoother, less flakier scalp, while the shankhpushpi helped reduce my hairfall. All in all, I have never found a product that helps solve all my hair problems at once before trying out this mask! I recommend it to people of all hair types, since I will also definitely be repurchasing this product.",Reviewed in India on 23 March 2022,2 people found this helpful,,

Bad packaging.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are literally micro-mini. I don't think its possible to apply them directly on lips without breaking them as they are very delicate. You will need a lip brush. I received them in the condition you see in the images. Disappointed with the shabby state. Packaging should have been better. Not very pigmented will need more of it to cover so maybe 2-3 uses at the most for adults. Does not transfer easily once you apply it though so ticks smudge proof box.  Did not find it moisturizing. I got this as a gift for my 3 yr old neice obsessed with makeup as it does not have harmful chemicals even if she gets some on herself. She is happy with the variety and uses it on her dolls mostly. It served my purpose. But if you are considering it for yourself treat it as a sampler to pick colors you like, though at this price and quantity its quite an expensive sampler.",Reviewed in India on 28 July 2022,8 people found this helpful,,

Best buy so far,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LONG REVIEW !This package of 16 color is absolutely worth buying. Before buying I was seeing the reviews and saw some people saying that this is very fragile and they broke easily. However,I still went ahead and bought it.Boss , what do you want in such a competitive price? Handle it carefully thats it.I have tried 4-5 color so far and loved them. Texture and feel are so good. People said it has good smell, but I didn’t feel any smell as such. It could be a mild smell there.Pros1. First of all getting 16 shades in just Rs 488 discounted price is a steal deal.2. These are Ayurvedic and made up of natural ingredients3. It stays for good 3-4 hrs which is still fine4. Gives moisture to your lips5. All shades are good and goes with all type of skin colour6. The smaller size is actually good as you buy big lipsticks which end up getting wasted after their expiry. This is a great deal if you want to save 1000s of Rs spent on lipstick and not use it completely.Cons (personally not a con for me)1. Since these are very small and when you close the cap you may end up breaking it. But dude, you have got a very good deal. You can handle it carefully. Don’t apply much pressure. Apply side ways rather than placing directly on lips from tip.2. Rather than giving in lipsticks shape, it could have been given in palatte3. It doesn’t stay for long but its fine you can re apply4. Not smudge proof (Not a con for me personally) . That way it becomes easy to remove itOverall it’s a super saver deal. Once I use this, would love to buy again.

Not Worth It,3.0 out of 5 stars,My girlfriend ordered this to know the perfect shade for her. But she feels it now a complete waste of money. Its overly priced.

GOOD NATURAL SHAMPOO BUT.......,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It is My Review on flipkart. Just thought of adding my review here also!😊 I bought 35ml bottle.Thanks for making small packing of 35ml. It really helps to try the product before buying 200ml bottle which is very costly. Also, I really appreciate that the ingredients used are natural or organic and chemicals used are mostly safe.Most Importantly NO SLS, SLES or PARABENS used👍😊MY REASON for 4 STARS⭐ is written at end!My Review after using it 2 times in last 3 days:Firstly, Though the shampoo is in liquid form, still it doesn't lather much because of being natural and free from lather producing harmful chemicals! It lathers much much less than non-natural shampoos like Dove, Pantene, etc even if you take more quantity of it. So best is take only required quantity as per your hairs and just rub on your hands and apply on the hairs and do not expect much lather.Though it lathers less, but still it is safe and cleans the hair well!It doesn't make my hair SUPER SOFT but provide good amount of Softness and Smoothness to dry hair👍4 STARS⭐ BECAUSE :Though most of the ingredients used are good, but It contains an ingredient called cocamidopropyl Betaine(CAPB). You can call it as a natural ingredient as it is coconut-derived. But PROBLEM is It might IRRITATION on long usage or on short Usage if your skin is sensitive to CAPB. SO, I KINDLY REQUEST JUST HERBS TO USE MORE SAFER ALTERNATIVES.But, STILL It's a MUCH SAFER option than most famous shampoos which contains SLS, SLES or PARABENS.",Reviewed in India on 27 August 2021,One person found this helpful,,

Did not suit sensitive combination skin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried the Mamaearth face wash because all week, I don’t really get time to cleanse my skin with elaborate steps. I thought this facewash would be an all-in-one solution for treating tan, exfoliating and cleansing. But, after using for 3-4 times, I experienced a massive pimple break-out, with very painful and rapidly multiplying pimples. This face wash doesn’t suit all skin types like it claims. I have attached a picture of how my cheek looks, and that is the case with both my cheeks. I stopped using the face wash right after using it for 3-4 times, and, even after more than a month, I have very painful pimples breaking out. The skin looks instantly fresh but vigorous exfoliation did not suit my skin. I used to use the face wash once in 3 days.",Reviewed in India on 24 December 2022,3 people found this helpful,,

Perfect Facewash,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had tried this product majorly because of the name and ingredients that it has. For the first time a company is able to get the product that is based on our ancient secret recipes of our Dadi Nani... a person like me who has super dry skin, this is the perfect product for me as it hydrates my skin thoroughly and gives an instant freshness like the way ubtan gives. Very good for my super dry & super sensitive skin. Loved this product. Kudos mamaearth for this amazing thought behind this product. This product has turmeric in it, which is the best to brighten your skin. I tried this product and I noticed that my tan is getting brighter. I go out in the sun very often so this product is the best for me as it has sun protection properties too. I am simple loving this face wash these days. I""ve been using this facewash nowdays & do believe me results are super awesome. It is very mild face wash with tiny exfoliating beads & scrubbing properties which removes dead skin as well. Its creamy in texture nd removes all signs of tan. Dermatologicallt tested & certified toxin free. Asia""s first madesafe certified brand. Literally wow. After using their blemish cream i got my hands on this face wash and i am so happy i got this. I loved this product. Firstly all the natural products are used by this brand and secondly its a quite effective for tan removal. As it contains particles to scrub the dead skin away which makes the skin softer and brighter. Plus its ingredients like liquorice extracts and saffron etc which helps in skin lightning and are great in qualities which makes it an overall great face wash. Must add it in your vanity. I love this face wash n its true because i used many herbal kind of face wahes then i moved to the diy face wash which are making all natural home ingredients. After trying all this and wanna sumthing pure like my diy in todays hectic life i got this and i totally fell in love with this thanku amazon and mama earth foundrs make our life pure harmless and totally vegan. Amazing face wash, face doesn't feel dry or stretchy, best for sensitive skin.

So you can get the best idea about this product. This facewash gives a freshness to my face and also deepcleanse it. So I like it. The facewash smells like a combination of Haldi and Saffron. But it did not suit for my wife’s face much and she got some pimples on her forehead after using this for few days. So you should not scrub your face daily using this face wash as recommended by this product. I also have used their Vitamin C face wash and this one is better than that for me. It may cause pimples for sensitive skins.,Reviewed in India on 13 June 2021,,,

But the People like me who has nomal to oily skin and normal color and want to become fair does not like this because your skin tone doesn't change and even after washing your face you won't feel that freshness . In beginning everything will be good 😜 as it is new to us but after passing some time we won't get any interest on it .

One of the best facewash,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have also used this facewash in past and I can say this is one of my favourite facewash. This facewash is very mild and gentle on face does not cause any breakout and is suitable for all skin type people. Most important this facewash is free from harsh chemicals, paraben & sulphate and is dermatologically tested . It is made up of natural ingredients like saffron extract, carrot seed oil, liquorice extract, turmeric powder, Coconut oil and so on.. all these ingredients helps to repair skin from sun damage caused by exposure to the harsh rays of sun, saffron and turmeric come together to remove sun tan while restoring the skin's natural glow . Walnut beads present in it gently exfoliates dead cells to reveal the natural glow in our face. Also this facewash has very pleasant smell & very less quantity is required just a pea size. I would recommend this to everyone go for it guys . It makes our skin smooth , supply and younger looking.",Reviewed in India on 2 June 2021,One person found this helpful,,

Fantabulous,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best facewash I've used in my oily skinned life. Even when you're sweating, you don't secrete sebum for hours after using this facewash. Perfect for deep cleaning, freshness and tan removal (to an extent). Its really outstanding. It has small granules of something, that works like scrub. So, use more water when using it daily, since your skin doesn't always need scrubbing. Also, don't use it harshly over your skin, just use it gently, scrub more near nose, the facewash will automatically do the job of cleansing without much scrubbing. Not recommended for sensitive skin at all. Only recommended for oily skin if you don't have active acne.",Reviewed in India on 7 August 2021,5 people found this helpful,,

Please AVOID this if you care for your hair.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst shampoo I have ever used. It has lot of problems. I should have earlier understood, why MamaEarth is giving lot of money to YouTubers to promote this shampoo. Let me enumerate the problems it has :-It is highly highly sticky. Even after emptying whole bucket of water while cleaning the hair, stickiness of shampoo doesn't get removed. Hair becomes hard and sticky day by day. And moreover application of oil to hair exacerbate the problem.-It doesn't clean the scalp or hair at all. Dirt still remains there even after rigorous application of shampoo.Also, anything we apply before shampoo like Aloevera, Lemon, Onion juice, etc is not completely removed even after taking too much shampoo and washing with lot of water.-It aggravates the hairfall problem to more worse. It has lead to dandruff poblem in my hair. Every from second day after this shampoo, dandruff start building in the scalp. This doesn't used to happen before.-Hair becomes firzzy, lifeless, sticky, hard, rough after application of this shampoo.-I know it doesn't contain Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, so will not create lot of froth but while using this we have to squeeze a lot of shampoo and still what we see is that hairs are not cleaned. Too much shampoo, too little cleansing. Marketing technique to sell out more shampoo. Pathetic strategy.So my overall suggestion is that please completely avoid this company's product, specifically this shampoo. MamaEarth is using lot of marketing gimmicks to sell their products but the quality of their products is pathetic. Don't fall into the trap of the people on youtube or elsewhere who are going gaga over it and praising a lot. All are paid reviews. Please better avoid this shampoo if you care for hair. But still if you want to take risk, then use this shampoo for one month and you will know the dark side of this shampoo. I generally never give negative reviews a lot but this MamaEarth shampoo deserves to be exposed. This company is thriving just on the basis of marketing. I have seen many people who are facing similar issues. I warn you buy this shampoo at your own risk.",Reviewed in India on 5 February 2021,19 people found this helpful,,

You can feel that it is natural..,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hey there..I have used this shampoo for a fairly long time now, and I must say it has been a good experience. This shampoo actually feels soft in comparison to mainstream shampoos like head and soldier etc. and it leaves a soothing effect after washing. It has a mild fragrance, that does not disturb your senses. I can not say much about its anti-hair-fall effect, hair-fall depends on your complete lifestyle, only changing your shampoo won't do much.But for the shampoo it self, it is good, it feels good using it. You will not regret buying it.For use cases, I feel it is good for dry hair, as it leaves a moist feeling hair after wash. If you have an oily scalp, I think you should go for another one.Thank you for reading my review!",Reviewed in India on 28 December 2021,One person found this helpful,,

My hair literally, on touch; feels like straw and I keep feeling it's dirty as well. I have used both the shampoo & conditioner. Isn't the conditioner supposed to condition and make your hair feel smooth, if not soft and bouncy?Overall I don't know about how well it does its actual work of hairfall control, but it sure does the job in making your hair feel lifeless and dead. Don't get me wrong i swear by mamaearth's aloe vera gel for skin, the part that it says about hair hasn't really worked for me, it too left my hair with the same feeling as the shampoo & conditioner did.P.S.- will get back with the hairfall control bit",Reviewed in India on 15 April 2022,One person found this helpful,,

"Not for coarse, frizzy hair or humidity...Pick your villain",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am writing this review after 8 washes. My reasons for 1 star are stated below:This shampoo does not lather. At first I thought it may be because of water quality but other brands don't mind lathering.Smell is not happening, it doesn't feel fresh or anything rather it smells like so many natural materials tried to blend chemically.Zero results on hair. My hair type is extremely dry and frizzy and I saw a high recommendation for this product but it looks like my hair is from a few cases where this shampoo cant work its magic.I experienced severe hair fall from the 1st wash but to see results I continued for almost a month and still not working. Hair became rigid and more frizzy and very unpleasant to touch.There should be a small bottle to try then go for it. I had to buy a big bottle which I can’t use but simply money wasted. Maybe money making gimmick but if the product is good as per claim no need to play such tricks isn't it ?If you have coarse, damaged, frizzy and dry hairs and are living in a humid area think thrice before buying it , or try it once like a sample then buy a big bottle which just occupies the shelf but does nothing.P.s : No complains for amazon, packaging was amazing and received on time.",Reviewed in India on 14 August 2020,22 people found this helpful,,

Good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is no doubt good. Has an amazing fragnance. The only drawback is that it fails to remove the oil completely from the hair, if u oil ur hair and shampoo.

If this can be worked upon then the product will definately stand for a 5 star rating.",Reviewed in India on 20 September 2019,,,

Bad One! Don't buy it!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Mamaearth is just a hyped brand. This shampoo is not good at all. They advertise it telling its high value while the actual product is very bad. The brand name does not justify the product. In the first wash itself, my hair went very dry. After that, for next 2-3 days, my hair felt thinner than usual. Also, it generates very small lather, which might prompt you to use in more quantity in order to properly cleanse your hair. Even after that, hair does not seem to be cleaned.

First, I bought their body butter, then the foot cream as a part of my night ritual. Finally, with the summer in, got their moisturizer.Trust me as I write this, 'their products feel like wrapping yourself in mum's love'. Absolutely pure, amazingly nourishing and adorably pleasant on mind, body n soul. Since, I am well aware of the usage of essential oils, I can bet these products do contain a fine quality of ingredient list.

No thanks,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very particular about what I put on my skin. I don't want anything with chemicals in any form. This claims to be all natural, but once you look at the ingredients list, it has several chemical compounds that are hard to pronounce. These compounds are derived from nature and heavily processed and no longer natural. The box claims to only keep out ""harmful chemicals"". Some of these ingredients can cause irritation to those with sensitive skin, so try a skin test first. I did try it once on my hands to test it. There was a slight burning sensation, but not bad. However, it left my hands very greasy, and my phone screen was covered in oil. It felt as if my hands had a layer of oil on them. I had to wash my hands to stop the burning and to get the oily feel off. The smell is nice and smells natural, which was a positive since it doesn't contain any perfumes/fragrances. Overall, I would have to say ""No thanks"" to this product. I won't buy it again!",Reviewed in India on 27 January 2023,One person found this helpful,,

"The best body wash - effective, safe and soft on skin",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my wife and kids (3 year and 1.5 year old). I also tried it on my face. This body is wash is a bit different from other body washes. You need to look at with out any judgement based on the usual body wash you find in Amazon and supermarkets. A good body wash should clean the skin, and not just lather and give a mental feeling. Too much form is no sign of quality. And the body wash should not make skin dry or moisturize it artificially. It should not smell too strong too. It is not expected of a body wash to generate a new smell.And this product thus meets all of my expectations. It does not lather a lot. It need not to applied using a loofah or fiber. It does not have a strong smell. It does not make skin dry. And additionally, the company claims that the body wash is without harmful chemicals like Parabens, Mineral Oil, Sulpathes and even lesser known for Behavioral toxins, Carcinogens, Developmental toxins, Endocrine disruptors, Heavy metals, Neurotoxins, Reproductive toxins or Nanoparticles such as DEA/TEA, Phenoxyethanol, PEGs.ProsCleans well, not hard on skin.ConsIt is costly.  I wish more people would buy it, helping the company to bring down the cost of manufacturing.",Reviewed in India on 18 March 2018,17 people found this helpful,,
Happy With My Buy,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is an overall satisfactory product. The biggest thing I would say though is that it is untoxic and chemical free. That is the only reason I have bought this body wash because I could have gotten many such products far cheaper quantity wise. But this body wash is safe to use. It smells (scent) like Great Gatsby though (Indonesian men's body wash brand). Lathers not too much but adequately. Usually it's the sulphate that makes shampoos and body gels lather so the fact that it doesn't lather much is kind of relieving. Get this if you care about harmful chemicals in your bath products.,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2020,One person found this helpful,,
Absolutely love it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is long overdue. But here it goes!Personally, I was always concerned about my skin during my pregnancy and getting the right kind of skincare is always a bit challenging. There are already a ton of things that you go through when you are pregnant and changes to your body is always one that keeps you concerned. I have always been very careful of the products I use and that’s why finding the most natural and chemical-free products during this phase was quite high up on my list.Sitting in London, there were just way too many choices but I wasn’t sure if they would work. I then stumbled upon The Moms Co. and absolutely loved the products, especially the body butter and the body of the wash. I got ordered these a number of times throughout my pregnancy.Apart from the usual baggage that comes with being pregnant, heartburn is something that kept me awake at nights. The Moms Co.’s tea for pregnancy acidity was really helpful during this phase. Just a little bit and it eased the acidity.I would highly recommend these products. I continue to use them post delivery and love the feel of it on my skin.",Reviewed in India on 24 August 2017,2 people found this helpful,,
Great Product. Perfect for Moms. Suitable for Moms to be!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this shower gel twice daily with a loofah. It is hands down a great product!Pros -1. Unlike other body washes, this one does not lather. It is a myth that if your soap or wash lathers only then you get clean. In fact, lack of lather shows how natural the product is. Thumbs up for this!2. No harmful chemicals + Australian Certified + Made Safe Product + Dermatologically tested. This means it is super safe to be used by Moms and Moms to be.3. Leaves the skin very supple because of the goodness of the essential oils used.4. The beautiful aroma of the wash keeps lingering for a good time.5. Overall does what it claimsCons - Priced slightly on the higher side. (This may be an issue to some, but for all the pros, this con can be easily ignored)Thanks The Moms Co. for such a beautiful product. As a mother, I really feel relaxed and refreshed after using this shower gel. Looking forward to use other products from your brand.",Reviewed in India on 27 March 2018,5 people found this helpful,,

Good quality must buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product Will not rip off moisture from your skin as it’s free from sls sles parabens n other harmful chemicals which make the skin dry !Expect the wash to foam less as it’s free from sulphates but that doesn’t mean you have to use double the quantity to clean your skin..! The fragrance is also nice ! Well packed bottle! Does moisturize too but if you have dry skin you will have to use a moisturizer for sure ! All fancy brands claim to be vegan or free from Paraben but read the ingredients you will see they are all loaded with sls sles and other chemical ! Go for it !I even suggest the hair serum from this company ! Works for dry frizzy hair but you will have to take more quantity !,Reviewed in India on 6 August 2020,,,

Extremely disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been seeing overwhelmingly positive reviews for this brand. The shampoo didn’t work very well (made my hair super sticky) but I thought I’d check out other products to make an informed evaluation of the products. I wanted to support ethical startups using natural products so went for another try.Boy, do I regret it. The face wash is extremely drying. I thought it was the initial phase of using different products, but the skin from my nose continued to peel even after 3 weeks of using the product. I followed it up with the Moms Co. face serum and used moisturiser too.My face broke out like never before. I had started to control my acne after many years with rigorous diet changes and multiple consultations and now it looks worse than before.The worst part of the experience however was the customer service. I followed up with them because I still believe small startups using natural produce should be supported and I honestly wanted advice on what to do for my skin and hair (I still want to go natural). While the customer relations personnel was sweet, I had to follow up many times and eventually returned disappointed because she had zero tips for me, leave alone reimbursement or alternative product suggestion.In conclusion: Don’t waste money on this stuff. DIY is your best friend- from ubtan to shea/ olive oil and essential oils, all of this is safer than this face wash.",Reviewed in India on 18 February 2019,81 people found this helpful,,

A very nice mild shampoo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For someone looking for a mild shampoo, this one is beautiful. It doesn't lather much but leaves a very clean scalp. It leaves the hair squeaky clean, however they don't feel very soft. Nothing a conditioner can't solve. Ensure to condition well after the shampoo.Being a sulphate and paraben free shampoo it does tend to have a short life but ideal for curly hair which lacks protein mostly. I would definitely recommend it. I have used other products from a high end range and this works similarly. Definitely will repurchase.",Reviewed in India on 1 August 2022,2 people found this helpful,,

The hairfall seemed  reduced after continuous washing for 5 days daily. but returned when switched to 2 washes in a week . So I'm confused. Doesn't have courage to try more. So stopped using.

"Now it is the worst shampoo, earlier it was really good",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Since last 4-5 months, this shampoo is causing severe hair fall and thinning. I have been using it since last 2 years, and it was magic to the hair, made it strong, thick, shinning and added volume. But I think a few month back, they have added foaming chemicals like SLS, Sulphate etc. because customers were earlier complaining about very less foam and they had to use very large quantity for a wash. But guys, don't you understand that for more foam, they have to use SLS. So I think the company has added loads of SLS in this shampoo or some very harmful chemicals for too much foam in recent months, because now I can see lots of foam even with a small quantity of shampoo. And that is causing severe harm to the hair and hair fall and thinning. I want Amazon to pass on this strong negative feedback to the company Mom's Co and ask them to stop using any SLS or any harmful chemicals for foaming and bring this shampoo back to earlier it was originally. And I want Amazon to refund my money which I spent to buy this shampoo last time. I'm also going to post the same bad review for this shampoo in Mom's Co website directly.",Reviewed in India on 26 November 2022,5 people found this helpful,,

The oiliness of the scalp has reduced considerably and my hair feels softer.The only negative about this is that the shampoo itself it very dilute. It has the concentration of regular clear shampoos mixed with water in equal parts, so it gets over super quickly. Considering the price, you'd want the shampoo to last substantially.",Reviewed in India on 1 September 2018,14 people found this helpful,,
Not worth,1.0 out of 5 stars,Being a new mom myself I ordered this shampoo expecting some good results. But let me clear the air here. It does not do anything it claims to do. I normally oil & leave my hair overnight and then wash next day. This shampoo could not remove the oil and my hair was still greasy post the wash (I have used Biotique and Khadi and they do a much better job of cleaning away the oil). I thought that maybe there was too much oil so next time I oiled and left my hair for only an hour. Same result. Although during the wash my hair felt clean but the moment it was dry it felt sticky and frizzy both at the same time.Also it transparent in color and you have to take so much extra in your hands for a better wash.As for controlling hair fall NO WAYS. Uptill now I was having no hairfall coz I am on heigh protein diet as I am nursing my 4 month old. But this shampoo from the first application itself gave me immense hairfall. Regret buying this product at such heavy price.,Reviewed in India on 24 April 2018,10 people found this helpful,,

Dubious product - Another synthetic Body Wash laced with chemicals,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product does not deserve more than a single star rating here. For one, it was delivered in a flimsy packaging with just some scotch tape wound around its nozzle. It could have been easily tampered with for all you know. I am really dubious about its authenticity. It is quite possible that some cheap shampoo is inside the bottle. Anyway, I thought of using the product since I had paid a premium price to acquire an organic and sustainable shower gel. It smells of nothing, which is good because it claims to be made of natural derivatives, but it gives away the natural tag as you mix it up with water. The body wash foams up like crazy. Lots of lather, which is a clear indicator that it is not made up of any natural derivatives, instead just another cheap shower gel. Buy at your own risk.",Reviewed in India on 23 August 2020,17 people found this helpful,,

Low rating as facewash hole is deliberately too big so that it gets finished quickly,2.0 out of 5 stars,"GOOD:1. It is fully organic / chemical free as the brand says. If true, then its very goodBAD:1. The facewash is very costly.2. The biggest problem is that the hole is big. If any normal person presses it, a huge amount will come out which may get wasted. As a result, the facewash will finish quickly. Its a smart design strategy but as a customer I did not appreciate such gimmicks to make more sales. Probably due to this, I may not opt for this in future for repeated buying.",Reviewed in India on 30 December 2020,6 people found this helpful,,

Very good hair cream,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Though it says that it gives a little hold, but it gives a really good hold for more than 6hrs. I have very thin hair, so without a Hairgel or cream my hair easily looses whatever hold I give. But this Arata hair cream gives a very good hold. After a little use of hair dryer, I used it. And best part is that unlike HairGels, it doesn't gives too much of rugged, tight hair texture. Rather it gives a very good natura hair texture. You wont see your hair as  solid, unmovable, too stationary look as happens in hair gels. Even if ur hair looses the hold, just simple put ur fingers over your hairs, it will gain shape .

I have tried arata's gel which came with a lid that was sealed with cellophane.Next, the product itself had a strange sticky mucous-y texture with bubbles. The overpowering musky, cheap -90s-middle-aged-macho fragrance was dreadful and did not go away. Even brylcream smells better.Used it after leave-in. It gave a mild hold which was fine and ok definition. But after drying and fluffing (no scrunching needed), my head was frizz central. By the next day, hair was rougher,dryer,and frizzier without any shine or smoothness. Had to oil my hair and wash it off. Never used it again and don't know what to do with that box full of product. Waste of money.",Reviewed in India on 29 August 2020,6 people found this helpful,,

Must use for thinning hairs,5.0 out of 5 stars,I travel too much and that too in polluted cities. I noticed my hairs getting thin when even a slight pressure during combing resulted in huge hair loss.

Cream is light and fragrance is very soothing. It doesn't works as gel and not to be used for holding hairs but the ingredients are good and nourishing.

"It’s good for people with curly hair, not wavy hair",4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a great product but I feel it would be better suited to someone with 3A or higher hair. Mine is a 2B-2C and it isn’t helping much even after about a month. Maybe I need to keep using it? I don’t know. My friend swears by it and she’s got lovely curls so my review is really based on her. So I guess it’s just a person-to-person situation.The scent puts me off a little. It reminded me of the Veet Hair Removal Cream the first time I tried it. It’s better now and doesn’t smell as bad as that first time. But still reminds me of it lol.,Reviewed in India on 22 August 2021,38 people found this helpful,,

This gel changed my life.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My hair has always been slightly wavy & very frizz prone. I've never known what to do with it, so I always straightened or curled it with hot tools to make it look good.Then a few months ago I got to know of the curly girl method and natural ways to style your hair. So I gave it a try & never looked back!This is easy to use, has good clean ingredients & still gives me excellent hold. I have extremely porous hair & live in Mumbai where humidity is hitting 90% almost daily & still I'm protected from frizz all day. It does dry very crunchy but I SOTY (scrunch the crunch out) with a lightweight oil or serum.This fades away by the second day but there's no crunchiness or residue like some hair spray. This is the only gel I've tried but I'm going to keep buying this (I'm already on my second tube & have bought the third as a backup). Would recommend it to all wavy / curly girls looking for a product to help form & hold your waves / curls - I also have a video on my youtube channel explaining & demonstrating how to use this.",Reviewed in India on 6 July 2020,23 people found this helpful,,

Best NATURAL hair gel you can buy 😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So it arrived today. Packaging was nice and product looks premium. Coming to quality, the best thing about this gel is that it is natural and extremely less harmfulI used it for the first time today and i can tell, it smells fabulous you'll fall in love with the smell of it. The hold it gives is just ok, fine for shaping your hair. Hold also lasts pretty long. If you're buying this product to get the same hold as the other gels or wax provide, which are full of harmful chemicals then you should avoid this. It's not for you.As also don't fall in Arata's marketing strategy that you can use it daily. Plz don't do that. It's gel after all, just it contains natural ingredients. It will surely harm your hair in the long run (im talking about boys, not sure about curly hair girls). Boys can use it twice or thrice a week. ✌️",Reviewed in India on 15 July 2020,33 people found this helpful,,

No hold at all.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Doesn't make hair stiff or crunchy. Dries down fast enough, so doesn't give that wet look to hair. Easy to wash out, the scent isn'l isn't over powering. Helps minimise frizz.Cons: Has no hold what so ever.  So my curls don't hold their definition.Bottom line: If your purpose is for your hair to hold their style, then this gel isn't for you. If you have naturally curly hair, with good definition already, then this is a good addition to cut down some frizz. Overall, for my very wavy hair, this product did nothing at all.",Reviewed in India on 26 December 2019,4 people found this helpful,,

Their messaging on using non-toxic materials is interesting, and definitely a positive.  But for me, it didn't do anything since it fails to do the basic job.  The gel oozes out like a semi-liquid, is non-sticky.  Packaging is definitely premium.  May it works for women (am no expert as to how women use hair gel), but for my needs, this didn't work.

It surely has that one, maybe lesser than usual products (as it provides very very less hold, just the wet look).Conclusion: I will not recommend this because:*It still has the chemical that hold your hair together (very less maybe).*It provides very less hold.

Ingredients are CG friendly but the result is not.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this from the arata website after reading reviews from a lot of CG  bloggers including CuriousJalebiI agree this is a nice lightweight gel and maybe good for men or women who want a slickwet look but it has ZERO hold.It was impossible to create a gel cast. Diffusing caused the gel cast to break prematurely and caused over moisturized type frizzing.After rebalancing...second time around and using almost half the tube I managed to get a gel cast which caused major MAJOR moisture overload.Fyi: I have fine strand, type 2b/2c low to medium porosity frizzy hair with a sensitive scalp.I would not recommend this to any CG who is less than a type 3c who needs a good hold and a good gel cast.Yes the ingredients are ""natural"" and I don't like fragrance in my products so theoretically this relatively fragrance free gel should have made me happy. But frankly it was a waste of money and homemade flax seed gel would have been a better use of time.",Reviewed in India on 19 September 2019,,,

I admit that these shampoo and conditioner were preceded by religious oil therapy ( thanks hubby) but these shampoo conditioner just calmy removed excess oil and relaxed my unbearable itching scalp. In a month, i have shiny hair, calm scalp and 1.5 inches of hair growth.

Arata is one of the first few curly hair products in the Indian market and the prices were quite reasonable, so I thought I’d give it a shot. The Arata gel is good, I liked the hard cast which needs to be scrunched till hair gets soft, their cream smelt like strong chemicals so I did not purchase their latest green label hair cream. After using the shampoo and conditioner my hair feels ripped, damaged and frizzy. Shampoo smells like toothpaste. Used the products for two washes- won’t be using them again. Hope I’ll be able to reverse my hair damage. It is not curly hair friendly. Unlike their disclaimer on the product which says “NO TOXIC STUFF.

I think it may not work for everyone. this is an okay shampoo, i have almost used the whole bottle now cos i couldnt throw my money away and i wash my hair once a week. it doesnt leave my hair dry and  but it doesnt lather and it says this on the bottle also so i have to drench my hair alot and double cleanse sometimes to make it lather. i have always used sulphate shampoos and they lather well so i miss that. i have also noticed that on amazon there are fake reviews. i am very upset with this.",Reviewed in India on 14 February 2023,One person found this helpful,,

But then my hair dried... and this became my favourite shampoo!My hair has such oily texture but at the same time can be dandruffy if the air is too dry. This shampoo surprisingly dealt with both problems... Which I didn't think possible. I just like my hair now after it's washed. It falls all light and airy and clean.",Reviewed in India on 9 March 2023,,,

It's good but doesn't suit me,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm facing literally extreme hairfall so I decieded to switch some organic products ..first I use mukti herbals shampoo for 3 months and it stops my hairfall to some extent but the shampoo cause dandruff to me...then I choose to use arata products after some research ..at the start ...it seems to be fine but after 7-8 months ..I'm facing emense level of hairfall...I can't even write in words ....may be it's because of my body type coz everyone body type is different...But if u r not facing any hairfall and just trying to use organic products and always been at ur native place then u give it a try ..it's a good product ...the texture after washing the hair is also satisfying,Reviewed in India on 25 October 2022,3 people found this helpful,,
Does control hair fall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have already used half a bottle and i can say it does good to your hairs.. it did control my hair fall.. and it keeps your hair clean for almost 3days so if you sweat alot like me, your hair will not smell bad, thanks to this shampoo and conditioner.. 👍",Reviewed in India on 22 June 2022,2 people found this helpful,,
Doesn't deliver what it promises,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I guess it just doesn't work for my hair, but so far, I've been super disappointed with the product. The first time I used it on un-oiled hair, it left my hair feeling insanely dry. So the next time I decided to oil my hair a bit before using this shampoo and even after using TONS of it in just one wash, my head still had a bit of residue. And this is the case every single time. I've experimented with various levels of oil and shampoo over a month, and it's still the same. It's either too dry or oily. I don't think the shampoo cleanses well.And my hairfall is still pretty much the same. At some point, it felt like it had increased. Maybe it's just not suitable for my hair type, but i don't recommend this product.",Reviewed in India on 31 July 2022,One person found this helpful,,

I am a fan of this scrub,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been the best face scrub i have ever tried. This does not cause breakouts or any after effects like other scrubs, especially walnut scrubs when used on oily to normal skin. The best part is, you can also use it as a face wash. It says it is SLS and parabens free, but i myself could never detect the difference between products who have SLS and who don’t. But this definitely does not have any side effects even when used regularly for long time so i think it is SLS and parabens free for real. I used to have an oily skin but regular use of this scrub along with Richfeel calendula soap as an alternative to face wash, has made my skin so smooth and acne free. After washing my face with this scrub, i tone my skin using Biotique cucumber toner and then moisturise and massage my skin with Johnsons Baby Cream. This is my every night routine which is a really good alternative to expensive Korean skin regime products. One bottle goes a long way. You can see the difference in first wash itself. It makes the skin look fresh, removes dirt and oiliness, and leaves a healthy looking face. It has a really good fragrance. I love how my face and cheeks glow after using it. My friends tried this after listening to my reviews and they also fell in love with this product. This is my second bottle. The first one lasted for entire year.",Reviewed in India on 9 February 2020,9 people found this helpful,,

If the product is even slightly drying it produces bad results. This product, by far is the best I’ve ever used. It’s sooo much cheaper than your average conditioner and sooo moisturising and softening, plus it untangles the hair brilliantly.I feel Khadi is the real deal. Forget all this expensive, chemical laden rubbish from fancy brands that scam you. Keep it organic and real. These guys have a genuinely great product line going. They don’t need to waste their resources in packaging and advertising. Hence for all these reasons, I trust their products!",Reviewed in India on 13 November 2020,6 people found this helpful,,

A shampoo that is very close to a natural shampoo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"By the look and feel of the shampoo liquid, it appears it has the least amount of chemical and does have natural ingredients. The shampoo doesn't have much fragrance in it again being having more of natural ingredients I guess. Have used it for a month, it produces a sufficient amount of lather with small quantities (applicable to men). The bottle may last for close to a month depending on our daily consumption. Having actually used an Aloe vera on my hair rather than the Aloe vera based shampoo that this claims to be. After applying my shampoo, dandruff has reduced, hair has become shinier than before. However, hair fall hasn't dropped or stopped. Expecting the hair fall to stop after next month. For the price point, I expected the shampoo bottle to be a little bigger. I recommend this product to others to use.",Reviewed in India on 30 March 2020,One person found this helpful,,

Not very effective but no degradation of hair,4.0 out of 5 stars,It has a generous quantity for the price. The package was fully seal packed with shrink-wrap to prevent leakage or any kind of misuse.Smell is neither impressive nor prominent. Lather is decent enough. Though it does clean the hair but I didn't feel any visible effects. It is a dandruff shampoo but didnt do an impressive job. Just average nothing spectacular to expect.The good thing here was the after effect of using chemical shampoos was not present which usually happens with othr shampoos after 10-15 hours.

Go for it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third bottle and I just love this shampoo. The fragrance is amazing, texture is creamy and works well for my oily scalp.

Didn't work for me.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thin hairs, dry scalp and dandruff as well (medium, not heavy dandruff).After going through all the variety of products KHADI NATURAL SHAMPOO has & also after reading reviews for all the products, I felt that this particular type will be best for my requirements. Used it for 2 months.It was helpful with dandruff but only for 1-2 days from the wash. Dandruff came back easily & very soon. So it wasn't much of a relief. So people with heavy dandruff should think before buying it. My scalp did feel cleansed but not properly & deeply as the product promises. The product does moisturize the scalp well. Since I have a dry scalp, it was a good thing for me. Didn't help much with hair fall even though I used it with KHADI NATURAL CONDITIONER (SLS & PARABEN FREE). Though the shiny texture of the shampoo made me wonder whether it is 100% SLS & PARABEN FREE or not.Have to use a lot of quantity. 1 bottle lasts for 2 months for a single user (medium hair length).Product was delivered on time. The packaging was good. Received original product.",Reviewed in India on 18 June 2019,2 people found this helpful,,

"Use with care, and it may work",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm writing this review after throwing away 40% of the cream, as it changed colour and smelled rancid within a little over 1 month.It did work a little for my skin in terms of glow and a bit of glass skin effect, but after breaking out my skin badly to begin with ( and I never had pimples even as a teenager). But again, I heard natural it-It creams can make you breakout. So, it used it persistently.So, use with a lot of caution and care as it has a very short shelf life, but I'm not complaining, as I value a natural product over a chemical laden one.The company could really offer it in pump bottle, as touching the product with hand repeatedly and exposure to air is causing it to go bad. It is also runny and really greasy, so it can last for 2 months actually and a pump bottle can be really handy.However, I'm gonna buy it again to try it during winter, as I'm simply in love with the same range's Vit C face wash and toner (toner oxidizes too, but thankfully comes in a flip-top bottle). In short, the product can work for your skin if these issues are taken care of.",Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,,,
